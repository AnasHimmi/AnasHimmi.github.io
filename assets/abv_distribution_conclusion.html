    Beers in the Dark and Strong Ale cluster have the highest alcohol content, reflecting their robust and intense brewing styles. IPA beers follow closely, with most falling between 6% and 7% ABV, consistent with their traditionally bold and hoppy profiles.

    The Rich and Roasty Stouts cluster has a slightly lower average ABV, typically ranging between 5% and 6%. However, this cluster exhibits a long-tailed distribution, with a notable number of beers reaching up to 10% ABV. This indicates that while many stouts are moderately strong, there are also specialty and imperial versions with significantly higher alcohol content.
    
    Finally, Light and Refreshing Lagers are positioned at the lower end of the ABV distribution. Over half of the beers in this cluster have an alcohol content close to 5%, reflecting their easy-drinking and sessionable nature. This lower ABV aligns with the typical profile of lagers designed for refreshment and wide appeal.
