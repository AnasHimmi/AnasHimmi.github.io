    <p> <span class="highlight">BeerAdvocate</span> is very pleased with our results. To gain deeper insights into each cluster's characteristics, they requested additional analyses focusing on:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>ABV Differences: Comparing the average alcohol by volume (ABV) across clusters to highlight strength variations.</li>
        <li>Brewery Sizes: Identifying the typical number of beers brewed by breweries associated with each cluster.</li>
        <li>Best Seasons: Determining the most popular seasons for each cluster based on review activity, helping to link beer styles to seasonal preferences.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These analyses will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the clusters, enabling more personalized recommendations and community building.</p>
