        <span class="highlight">BeerAdvocate</span> seeks to understand the factors influencing beer ratings and has asked us to compare the ratings given by users across each cluster. Specifically, they want to identify if certain communities tend to rate beers more favorably than others. When a user rates a beer, the goal is to determine how to assess whether their rating is considered high or low in relation to the ratings of others within the same community.
