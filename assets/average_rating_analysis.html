        Based on your analysis of the histogram ratings for each cluster, here's how we can interpret the findings:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cluster 8 – Specialty and Niche Styles:</strong>
            This cluster, having the lowest ratings, suggests that beers in this category may be more polarizing or less
            accessible to the general beer-drinking population. Specialty and niche styles often appeal to more
            adventurous or specific tastes, which could explain the lower ratings from a broader audience. These beers
            might be seen as more experimental, leading to a higher likelihood of mixed reviews.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Cluster 0 – Light and Refreshing Lagers:</strong>
            Similar to Cluster 8, Cluster 0's relatively low ratings could indicate that light and refreshing lagers
            might be considered too simple or standard for some beer drinkers, especially compared to more complex
            styles. This could also reflect a preference for more intense flavors, with lagers perceived as less
            exciting or flavorful.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Clusters 1, 7 – High Ratings for Dark and Strong Ales, Sour and Experimental Beers:</strong>
            These clusters show higher ratings, which suggests that beers in these categories are appreciated for their
            bold, distinct characteristics. Dark and Strong Ales and Sour beers often have rich, complex flavors, and
            sour or experimental beers can offer unique and intriguing experiences that beer enthusiasts value. Sour
            beers, in particular, have seen an increase in popularity, and people who enjoy them often give high ratings
            due to the exciting, unconventional flavors.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Clusters 5 and 6 – Malty and Balanced Ales, Citrusy and Balanced IPAs:</strong>
            These clusters are also highly rated, indicating that these styles strike a good balance of flavors that
            appeal to a broad range of beer drinkers. Balanced ales and IPAs are likely considered more accessible and
            satisfying, with flavors that are well-rounded without being too extreme or niche. The favorable ratings
            suggest these styles have a strong fan base.
        </li>
        <li><strong>General Rating Trends:</strong>
            It’s interesting that most of the ratings fall between 3.5 and 4.5, reflecting a generally positive
            reception for beers in the BeerAdvocate community. The lower ratings for Cluster 0 and 8 could reflect
            personal preferences, but it also highlights the potential influence of the beer’s availability, the
            specific tastes of reviewers, or the overall complexity and innovation associated with the beer style.
