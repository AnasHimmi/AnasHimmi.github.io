    Smaller breweries are more likely to dominate clusters like Light and Refreshing Lagers and Citrusy and Balanced IPAs, which focus on lighter, hop-forward styles. Medium to large breweries are predominant in clusters such as Malty and Balanced Ales, Belgian and Wheat Styles, and Specialty and Niche Styles, which offer a broader range of diverse and experimental beers. The largest breweries are typically found in clusters like Hop-Forward IPAs, Sour and Experimental Beers, and Dark and Strong Ales, where larger-scale production and more diverse offerings are common.
