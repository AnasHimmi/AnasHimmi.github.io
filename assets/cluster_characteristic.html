  <h3>Cluster Characterization</h3>
  <p>
    With our clusters established, <span class="highlight">Beeradvocate</span> requested a detailed characterization of each one. Specifically, they want:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Main Beer Styles:</strong> Identifying the dominant beer styles in each cluster.</li>
    <li><strong>Key Appearance and Flavor Features:</strong> Highlighting defining traits such as color, bitterness, sweetness, or aroma.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These characteristics will help users find communities that align with their preferences. For example, an American Stout enthusiast might be curious about the distinct flavors that define this style, such as coffee and chocolate notes with dark/black color. They may also want to discover other beer styles with similar profiles, enhancing their exploration and engagement within the platform.
