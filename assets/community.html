        To improve user engagement on <span class="highlight">BeerAdvocate</span>, we developed a system to map users to predefined beer clusters based on their preferences and see to which communities they belong to. Using data from beer reviews, we applied <span class="highlight">Principal Component Analysis (PCA)</span> to the beer reviews text to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and identify key beer characteristics of each clusters. With the 5 principal components (PCs), we saw that the key characteristics that describes a beer were present in those 5 Principal Components which captured distinctions such as "balanced beers vs. rich and complex beers" and "sour and tart beers vs. hop-forward beers." These PCs were used to define clusters that represent unique beer styles, such as IPAs, stouts, and lagers. We then crafted five user-friendly questions aligned with the PCs that we had to interpret, allowing users to express their preferences on a scale of -1 to 1 for each question.

        User responses are normalized and scaled to align with the PCA space of cluster centroids. By calculating the Euclidean distance between the user's position in PCA space and the centroids of each cluster, we assign the user to the nearest cluster. This system enhances <span class="highlight">BeerAdvocate's</span> user experience by delivering tailored recommendations, enabling users to explore beer styles aligned with their tastes, and providing actionable insights into user preferences for platform improvement and targeted marketing. This interactive approach bridges the gap between user engagement and beer discovery, offering a personalized, data-driven experience. It also allows the user to find like-minded people who think like him but most importantly drink like him!
