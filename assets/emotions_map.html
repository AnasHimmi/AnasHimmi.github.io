        <span class="highlight">BeerAdvocate</span>, still curious about the differences in how beers are reviewed across different clusters, has asked us to analyze the main emotions expressed in the reviews. Specifically, they want to explore how emotions such as "joy," "trust," "anticipation," "disgust," "surprise," "anger," "sadness," and "fear" manifest within the reviews for each cluster. By analyzing the emotional tones, <span class="highlight">BeerAdvocate</span> hopes to uncover patterns in how users feel about the various beer styles and how their emotions correlate with the clusters. This could reveal whether certain beer styles evoke more positive or negative reactions, helping to further understand the preferences and sentiments of each community. It would also provide users with an added layer of insight into the experiences of fellow beer enthusiasts, offering a deeper understanding of how different beer styles are perceived emotionally.

        The main idea here is to demonstrate which emotions are associated with specific words used in the reviews. We are now able to analyze the emotions that emerge in reviews containing a particular word. However, given the extensive beer lexicon, we have limited our focus to the top two appearance descriptors and the top two flavor descriptors for each cluster. This allows us to highlight which emotions are most commonly associated with the key characteristics of each beer style. By focusing on these selected words, we provide a clearer understanding of how different beer styles are emotionally perceived based on their most prominent descriptors.
