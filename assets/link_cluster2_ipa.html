  <h4>IPA Enthusiasts' Findings</h4>
  <p>
    In our project group, we are all IPA enthusiasts. Initially, our goal was to extract key features of IPA beers and analyze their evolution over time, as well as their geographical distribution.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    After successfully clustering the reviews, we discovered that one of our clusters closely resembles an "IPA cluster."
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    In the following section, we will highlight this insight by comparing the key appearance and flavor descriptors of IPA beers with those of our second cluster. This provides further evidence of how effectively our clustering approach works. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The close alignment between the IPA beers and one of our clusters reinforces the accuracy and relevance of our method in identifying distinct beer styles and preferences.
