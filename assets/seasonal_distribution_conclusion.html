  <p>The seasonal distribution observed in the graph aligns perfectly with expected beer-drinking patterns based on typical style characteristics:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Light and Refreshing Lagers:</strong> These beers peak in summer, reflecting their crisp, thirst-quenching nature, ideal for hot weather.</li>
    <li><strong>Dark and Strong Ales:</strong> A noticeable rise is visible, which makes sense given their warming, high-alcohol profiles suited for cold seasons.</li>
    <li><strong>Hop-Forward IPAs:</strong> IPAs appear to be popular year-round, with a slight spring and summer increase. Their bold, hoppy flavors appeal to craft beer enthusiasts regardless of season but are especially refreshing in warmer months.</li>
    <li><strong>Rich and Roasty Stouts:</strong> A winter and fall clear peak confirms the preference for these robust, comforting beers during colder months.</li>
    <li><strong>Belgian and Wheat Styles:</strong> The graph shows a peak in spring and summer, reflecting their fruity, refreshing qualities, often linked to warmer weather.</li>
    <li><strong>Malty and Balanced Ales:</strong> The fall and winter peaks align with these beersâ€™ malty, smooth character, making them perfect for cooler seasons.</li>
    <li><strong>Citrusy and Balanced IPAs:</strong> A bigger presence in spring and summer highlights the popularity of these bright, citrus-forward IPAs during warmer months. However, since this cluster contains a smaller number of beers, the seasonal trend is less pronounced and harder to observe clearly.</li>
    <li><strong>Sour and Experimental Beers:</strong> These beers show a clear summer peak, consistent with their tart, refreshing nature that pairs well with hot weather.</li>
    <li><strong>Specialty and Niche Styles:</strong> The graph likely shows more scattered peaks, as these beers can be seasonal or brewed for specific events, varying throughout the year. Again, since this cluster contains a smaller number of beers, any trend would be less pronounced and harder to observe clearly.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Overall, the graph reflects a logical, seasonally-driven pattern that aligns closely with known beer style preferences. This suggests that the clusters not only capture distinct beer characteristics but also resonate with real-world drinking trends.</p>
  
  <p>We investigate here what's the size of the breweries for each style of beers. What should be expected on the market in terms of brewery sizes? For example, if we want to do some consulting for a really small brewery, brewing only a few 2-3 beers, we would probably recommend them to brew lager, as lagers are brewed by smaller breweries. Brewing "Dark and Strong Ales" might be difficult because it's more likely to be brewed by well-known breweries and brands.</p>
