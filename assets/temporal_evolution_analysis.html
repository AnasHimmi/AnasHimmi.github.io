        The Light and Refreshing Lagers (Cluster 0) and Malty and Balanced Ales (Cluster 5) are becoming less popular
        over time. Lighter lagers, such as pilsners and pale lagers, while still widely consumed, have seen a decline as
        craft beer drinkers increasingly seek more flavorful and innovative options. Similarly, malty and balanced ales,
        like amber ales, have been overshadowed by hop-forward styles and experimental beers that offer bolder flavors.
        On the other hand, Hop-Forward IPAs (Cluster 2) are gaining significant popularity. IPAs, particularly with
        intense hop profiles, have driven the craft beer movement, with constant experimentation in styles like New
        England IPAs and Double IPAs contributing to their growth. Additionally, Specialty and Niche Styles (Cluster 8),
        including sour ales and barrel-aged beers, are also on the rise as beer drinkers explore more unique and
        adventurous options. This shift reflects broader trends in the craft beer industry, where bold, innovative beers
        are gaining traction, while traditional, lighter styles are seeing a relative decline.
