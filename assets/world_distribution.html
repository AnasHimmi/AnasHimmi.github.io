        <span class="highlight">BeerAdvocate</span> has requested an analysis of the geographic distribution of beer clusters to better understand where different beer communities are most prominent. This information would provide valuable insights into regional preferences and brewing cultures. By identifying the locations where specific clusters are highly rated, users could discover where people with similar tastes are concentrated, helping them connect with like-minded beer enthusiasts.

For example, a fan of Hop-Forward IPAs might be interested in knowing which regions have a strong IPA-loving community or where other IPA enthusiasts are located.
